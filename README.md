# Datastructures_2_Assignment_1

The aim for this assignment was to make a system that the user could load a blood cell image for analyse.
This system requires that the image be a properlly prepared stained slide that would be used under a microscope.
Once the image has been selected through the file explorer some basic colour manipulation is done to produce a 
simple image that only contains red, purple and white pixels. Depending on what stain was you the colour manipulation
might not have correctly identified the different cells for this i have included two sliders which control the colour 
ranges for red and purple pixels, this allows the user to manually adjust the colour ranges to better suit the image used.
